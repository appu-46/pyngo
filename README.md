# Pyngo.py
Bingo game made using python

This is better looking and better performaing program than bingo.py I wrote earlier. 

This program checks the progress of game regularly and ends the game when a player wins automatically

In case you dont what bingo is :
RULES OF BINGO : 

1] Both the players are given a random 5x5 grid of 1 to 25 non-repeating numbers. (Note: Players can make their own grid too, but in my opinion the placement of the numbers doesnt really matter to win the game)

2] Player 1 gives a number that has to be striked from both the grids.

3] Now Player 2 gives a number and again, that numbers has to be striked from the grid.

4] As the round progresses, strikes go on, the strikes should make such a pattern that it covers entire diagonal/row/column of the grid.

5] Player that gets 5 such strike pattern first, wins the game. Here is an example image of thw winning condition for more clarification.

Here 1 diagonal, 2 rows, 2 columns (Total 5) are striked. Hence this Player1 has won the game.
